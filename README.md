# Rating-and-Recommendations

## Description
This project was implemented to test different data mining algorithms to measure the 
distance between users on a given data set of users and ratings for movies that they have watched.
## Implemented Algos
 * Manhatann Distance
 * Euclidean
 * Pearson
 * Cosine Similarity
 * ACS
 * Weighted Slope One
## Results
All algos were tested on the same data set and compared to infer which one gives the best results
i.e( gives the close users in order to recommend them movies ) , it turned out that the euclidean got
us good results because we are working in 2D Space otherwise it would have failed , so the pearson could work
in both cases.
